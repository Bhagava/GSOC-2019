    "2.The plugins have been developed in [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). Please refer to this [Hello World](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html) example to get started with IntelliJ. If you are well versed with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), then you can go with it. It has [good support and documentation](https://imagej.net/Developing_ImageJ_in_Eclipse) for developing ImageJ plugins. \n",

    "3.*Maven* is a tool which manages dependencies of your project and will also build it. IntelliJ will have Maven inside it. Basically, when you write a Java application, you would want to \"mavenize\" it(generate a `POM.xml` file and move source files to src/main/java) before packaging it into a JAR (Java ARchive) file. If you love command line workflow, Install [Apache Maven](https://www.javahelps.com/2017/10/install-apache-maven-on-linux.html) (Linux). *Please be careful with step 4 of this tutorial for installing Maven*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Download the [example-imagej-command](https://github.com/imagej/example-imagej-command). This is a maven project (see the `POM.xml` file) which takes in an image and applies Gaussian blur on that image. This can be used as a template. You can replace the `GaussFiltering.java` with your java code and also make respective changes to the `POM.xml` file. Once you are done with that you can generate the JAR file and place it in the plugins folder of `Fiji.app`."
